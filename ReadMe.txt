INFO6023 Algorithms and GEMS Project 1

Built and run in Visual Studio Community 2019 Debug and Release x64

This project and program is meant to be an API for "Snotify", I did not make a menu control for this project, so my main simply goes through and runs every command at least once in the API to test them.

Apologies for the length of the video.

Basically only used smart arrays cause I love em and could not get the map to work as I wanted.
Sorted using Merge (typically fastest) and some occasional Insertion.
Searches are all Binary after sorting, so even with large amounts of data at worst should only take O(n/2).
